# MyGame(Java Platformer Game)

## Description
This is a 2D platformer game made in Java using Swing.
This project was made to practice game loops, player movement, 
code architecture, working with Java's syntax, and game design in general.

This GitHub repo is intended to show my progress as a developer 
and this game's progress over time.
